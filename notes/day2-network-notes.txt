Day 2 - Network Behaviour Notes
- Verified outbound connectivity using ping
- Observed SSH listening on port 22 (primary exposed service).
- DNS resolver is bound to loopback (127.0.0.53), not exposed externally
- Current baseline shows minimal attack surface; good starting point for IDS deployment.
