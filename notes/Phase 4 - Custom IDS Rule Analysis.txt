Phase 4 - Custom IDS Rule Analysis

- A custom Suricata detection rule was created to identify ICMP echo request packets.
- The rule was designed using protocol-specific fields (ICMP type 8) and assigned a unique SID to ensure traceability.
- Network traffic was captured using tcpdump and replayed through Suricata using PCAP analysis mode.
- This method enabled reliable and repeatable testing of the custom rule in a virtualised environment.
- The successful generation of alerts confirms correct rule syntax, effective rule loading and proper IDS processing.
This phase demonstrates the ability to design, test and validate custom IDS signatures.
